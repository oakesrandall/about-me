# About Me

## Before GA:
I ran the digital content team for a TV station, before that, I ran day-to-day operations for entire newsrooms in a couple of markets.

## Outcomes support I need:
I need all of the outcomes support.

## Day 1 Goals:
1. Lean to be a competent developer so I can provide for my family in an environment that doesn't make me want to kill myself

## Meetups I've attended:
1. Hiring event at WeWork LOHI (I'll have to look up the date)
2. Denver Script (August)

## What type of company would you like to work for (i.e. Agency, Product, Startup)?
I'm not terribly picky about this one.  Most of all, I'd like to work in a role with a strong team so I can grow as a developer.

## What kind of role are you leaning towards (i.e. Frontend, Backend, etc)?
I feel pretty comfortable with the front end, but I really want to get better working on the back end.  I'm going to spend a lot of free time reading and working on node, psql and mongoose so I can look for a full-stack role.
